# TwitterBot

I built a twitter bot that replies to four commands: "help", "info", "inspiration", and "quote" with the bots username @kyliewise20 tagged. 

For tweets that mention the bot with keywords help or info my bot responds with information about how to use the bot.

For tweets that mention the bot with keywords inspiration or quote my bot responds with a quote from a quote API. 

This bot was built on my local computer, however I also built it on an API Python Anywhere. The reason it lives here is so that it can be sent/accessed by other computers easily and if I want to have it tweet or turn on at certain times throughout the day, I would be able to enable this through the Python Anywhere API.
